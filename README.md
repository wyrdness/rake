## Overview

The Rake is an internet-born creepypasta character that first appeared in 2005-2006 on the /b/ board of 4chan as a collaborative fiction project. Described as a pale, emaciated humanoid creature that crawls on all fours, has hollow eyes, and appears in bedrooms at night, **the Rake was explicitly created as fiction**.

However, like Slenderman, the character evolved beyond its fictional origins, with some people in the 2010s claiming genuine encounters. The Rake represents a fascinating example of modern digital folklore where **fictional creation leads to belief reports**, blurring lines between entertainment and perceived reality.

**IMPORTANT**: The Rake is a **documented fictional creation**, not a traditional cryptid or paranormal phenomenon.

## The Fiction-to-Belief Phenomenon

### How Fiction Became "Real" for Some

1. **Widespread Exposure**: Millions exposed to Rake stories online
2. **Sleep Paralysis**: People experiencing sleep paralysis interpret it through Rake imagery
3. **Suggestion**: Belief in Rake leads some to interpret ambiguous experiences as encounters
4. **Community Reinforcement**: Online communities validate each other's "experiences"
5. **Blurred Lines**: Line between fiction and belief becomes unclear for some

### Similar Cases

| Entity | Origin | Evolution |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Slenderman** | 2009 Something Awful forum | Fiction → belief → violent incidents |
| **Black-Eyed Children** | 1990s internet stories | Urban legend → claimed encounters |
| **The Rake** | 2005 4chan | Fiction → claimed sightings |

## Typical "Encounter" Pattern

Reported "encounters" follow consistent pattern:

1. **Night setting** — Always at night
2. **Bedroom location** — Victim in bed or bedroom
3. **Paralysis** — Often unable to move (sleep paralysis symptom)
4. **Pale figure** — See humanoid creature matching Rake description
5. **Terror** — Intense fear and dread
6. **Disappearance** — Entity vanishes
7. **Psychological impact** — Lasting fear and trauma

**This pattern perfectly matches sleep paralysis experiences.**

## Sleep Paralysis Explanation

### What is Sleep Paralysis?

- Brain awake, body still asleep
- Temporary inability to move
- Visual and auditory hallucinations
- Sense of presence in room
- Feeling of pressure on chest
- Intense fear and dread

### Why It Creates "Rake" Experiences

1. **Cultural Priming**: Person has seen Rake imagery online
2. **Sleep Paralysis Occurs**: Wake unable to move, hallucinate
3. **Brain Fills In**: Hallucination takes form of familiar scary entity (Rake)
4. **Genuine Experience**: Person genuinely experiences something terrifying
5. **Interpretation**: Attributes experience to "real" Rake encounter

**Different cultures see different entities during sleep paralysis:**
- **Medieval Europe**: Demons sitting on chest
- **Newfoundland**: Old Hag
- **Japan**: Kanashibari (bound by metal)
- **Modern Internet Age**: Slenderman, Rake, Shadow People

---

### 2. Sleep Paralysis + Cultural Priming

- Genuinely terrifying but explainable

**Evidence**: Pattern matches sleep paralysis exactly

---

### 3. Mass Suggestion

**Mechanism**:
