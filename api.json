      "summary": "A pale humanoid creature that originated as 2005 creepypasta fiction but evolved into claimed real experiences. Described as emaciated, crawling on all fours, with pale skin and hollow eyes.",
      "full": "The Rake is an internet-born creepypasta character that first appeared in 2005-2006 on the /b/ board of 4chan as a collaborative fiction project. Described as a pale, emaciated humanoid creature that crawls on all fours, has hollow or sunken eyes, and appears in bedrooms at night, the Rake was explicitly created as fiction. However, like Slenderman, the character evolved beyond its fictional origins, with some people in the 2010s claiming genuine encounters. The Rake represents a fascinating example of modern digital folklore where fictional creation leads to belief reports, blurring lines between entertainment and perceived reality. It is related to sleep paralysis experiences and demonstrates how internet culture creates new mythological entities."
